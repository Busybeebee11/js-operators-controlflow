        <h2>Javascript Operators & Control Flow</h2>
        <h3>Assignment</h3>
        <p>For this assignment, create a folder and name it <strong>operators-control-flow</strong>. Put the answers to
            Questions 1, 2 and 4 in a file named <strong>readme.md</strong>. For the coding questions, create a file and
            name it <strong>index.js</strong>. Use comments to label your answers..
        </p>
        
        <h3>Question 1</h3>
        <p>List the symbols for each of the below Javascript operators</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
            <li>Assignment Operators</li>
            <li>Comparison Operators</li>
            <li>Logical Operators</li>
            <li>Bitwise Operators</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Question 2</h3>
        <p>For each JavaScript Operator, write 2 examples.</p>
        
        <h3>Question 3</h3>
        <p>
            Bolatito just got admitted to Greenfield High School as an Arts student. To commence her studies, she needs to know
            the
            subjects she will be taking as an Arts student. All students have to take the General subjects.
        
        <p>The subjects for each class group are as follows:</p>
        <p>Science Subjects - Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Technical Drawing</p>
        <p>Social Science Subjects - Accounting, Commerce, Marketing, Geography</p>
        <p>Arts Subjects - Government, Economics, Literature, History</p>
        <p>General Subjects - English, Mathematics</p>
        
        <p>
            Using <strong>if…else</strong> conditional statement, write a program that will help Bolatito determine the subjects
            she will be taking
            for the session using her class group. Also, in the case of an invalid class group, your output should be the
            General
            subjects.
        </p>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Question 4</h3>
        <p>What is the result when the following program is executed?</p>
        
        <code><strong>for (let i = 1; i < 20; i +=7) { console.log(i) }</strong></code>
        
        <h3>Question 5</h3>
        <p>
            Write a program that takes a positive number <em>(num)</em> and finds the power of 2 nearest to that number. The
            program stores
            the resulting value to pwr. Then you log the answer in this format: <br>
            <em>“The number (pwr) is the power of 2 nearest to (num).”</em>
        <p>
            If there are two candidate values, display the smaller one. For example, 2 and 4 4 are both the powers of 2 nearest
            to
            3. The function should display 2 because it’s smaller than 4.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, <br>
            If num = 40, pwr = 32. Then you log to your console in this format: <br>
            <em>“The number 32 is the power of 2 nearest to 40.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            If num = 50, pwr = 64.. Then you log to your console in this format: <br>
            <em>“The number 64 is the power of 2 nearest to 50.”</em>
        </p>
